# osu! ranked lobbies

A bot that creates osu! lobbies, with an alternative leaderboard not based on performance points.

Contributions are welcome; if you have trouble getting the bot to run, feel free to message kiwec on discord (or on osu!).

***

## Development setup

### Prerequisite
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
* [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* (Windows Only) [Visual Studio 2013/2015/2017/2019 With C++ Option](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2022)
> Note: Downloading for MSVC, not for IDE


***

### Installation
* run `yarn`

* Copy `config.json.example` to `config.json` and add the required API keys.

>  The `sentry_dsn` setting is only required if you intend to run the bot in production, as it is used for error monitoring.


* Download `maps.db` [from my website](https://osu.kiwec.net/maps.db)

> You can also build it yourself: https://github.com/kiwec/orl-maps-db-generator

* Download and extract the latest `osu_files.tar.bz2` file [from data.ppy.sh](https://data.ppy.sh/) and extract the `.osu` files to the `maps/` directory

> This step isn't required, but makes profile scanning faster and avoids spamming the osu! servers with requests.

* run `yarn start`

* On first run, it will crash, so run `sqlite3 ranks.db < util/merge_maps_into_ranks.sql`.

> A bit janky, I know, I'll make it easier laterâ„¢.

## Feature flags

During development, you might not want to run the entire bot. You can disable the following feature flags in config.json:

* `CONNECT_TO_BANCHO`: connects to the osu! servers, rejoins lobbies, replies to in-game commands, etc.

* `APPLY_RANK_DECAY`: applies rank decay when the bot is started, and then every hour after that. Leave it off unless you're testing ranking changes.

* `CREATE_LOBBIES`: creates 4 lobbies automatically. Highly recommended to disable this (or edit the lobby creation code in index.js) during development.

* `CONNECT_TO_DISCORD`: connects to the discord api, reacts to interactions, changes user roles, etc.

* `HOST_WEBSITE`: hosts the o!rl website on port 3001.

* `ENABLE_SENTRY`: use Sentry service for error monitoring
